# EdeaBot

An old Discordie bot written with JQuery and RiveScript.
Uploaded to showcase her. I was proud of this bot once upon a time.

This code is presented as-is, and will not get any support. If you wish to use this 
code for your own discord bot, please refer to [rivediscord](https://github.com/seabirdshanty/rivediscord) for documentation, as EdeaBot was built off of this :D

Features:

- Reads token and Read/Writes "friendliness", last launch from an INI file
- Uses RiveScript for chatting
- Uses Rivescript commands to print command results (rive/commands.rive)
- Forces use of "standard" die or rolls are not allowed
- Allows milti-dice rolls
- Logs interactions that detriment friendliness into /logs folder
- Provides good music reccomendations :)
